The volunteers who run the database are passionate about security, privacy, integrity, and validation of the data in the database. Even though PeeringDB is a freely available and public tool, users strictly adhere to the acceptable use policy, which prevents the database being used for commercial purposes and discourages unsolicited communications. This is largely policed by the community and has been very effective since PeeringDB was launched."

msgid "Almost one-third of Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) register their interconnection data in the PeeringDB database. That means, by using PeeringDB and adding your own interconnection data, you’ll be able to confidently find information about networks looking to interconnect, where and how to connect with them, and they’ll be able to find the same information about your network. Since the database is user-maintained and validated by our volunteers, you can trust that the information is accurate and up-to-date."
